👋 Hi, I’m @KolyaKor👀

I’m interested in the world of game development, creating immersive and interactive gaming experiences for players.

🌱 I’m currently learning about game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, as well as programming languages like C# and C++ to build games.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game development projects that involve designing game mechanics, implementing gameplay features, and creating engaging visuals and audio.

📫 If you're passionate about game development or have ideas for game projects, let's connect!
